# Introduction to Python 🐍

**Python** is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language known for its readable syntax and strong community. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python emphasizes code readability and developer productivity, making it a great choice for beginners and professionals alike.

---

## Key features ✅

- **Readable & concise syntax** — code is easy to understand and maintain
- **Interpreted & cross-platform** — runs on Windows, macOS, Linux
- **Dynamic typing** and **automatic memory management**
- **Batteries-included** standard library for many common tasks
- **Vast ecosystem** of third-party packages (PyPI) for web, data, ML, automation

---

## Where Python is used 🔧

- Web development (Django, Flask)
- Data science & machine learning (NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, TensorFlow)
- Scripting & automation, DevOps
- Education, prototyping, and scientific computing

# Python Learning - Complete Syllabus

This syllabus covers Python basics through core OOP topics and practical examples. Use it as a checklist while studying.

1. Getting Started
   - Installation, interpreters, REPL, virtual environments
   - Running scripts, shebang, basic tooling

2. Python Basics
   - Syntax, comments, indentation
   - Data types: numbers, strings, booleans, None
   - Variables and assignments
   - Operators: arithmetic, comparison, logical, bitwise

3. Control Flow
   - `if`, `elif`, `else`
   - Loops: `for`, `while`, `break`, `continue`, `else` on loops
   - Comprehensions: list, dict, set, generator

4. Functions
   - Defining functions, return values
   - Positional, keyword, default args
   - `*args`, `**kwargs`
   - Lambda, higher-order functions, closures
   - Decorators

5. Data Structures
   - Lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries
   - Common methods, slicing, iteration
   - Collections module basics (`deque`, `Counter`, `defaultdict`, `namedtuple`)

6. Modules & Packages
   - Importing, package structure, `__init__.py`
   - `pip`, `venv`, `requirements.txt`

7. File I/O
   - `open()`, reading/writing files, context managers

8. Error Handling & Testing
   - Exceptions (`try`, `except`, `finally`, `else`)
   - Creating custom exceptions
   - Unit testing with `unittest`/`pytest`

9. Iterators & Generators
   - Iterator protocol, `__iter__`, `__next__`
   - Generators with `yield`, generator expressions

10. Concurrency & Async
   - Threads vs processes
   - `asyncio` basics, `async`/`await`

11. Standard Library Highlights
   - `os`, `sys`, `pathlib`, `datetime`, `json`, `re`, `logging`, `subprocess`

12. Advanced Topics (overview)
   - Context managers, descriptors, metaclasses
   - Packaging and distribution
   - Type hints and `mypy`

13. OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)
   - Classes and instances
   - Attributes and methods
   - Encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction
   - Special / magic methods (dunder methods)
   - `@classmethod`, `@staticmethod`, `@property`
   - Multiple inheritance and MRO
   - Abstract Base Classes (`abc`)

14. Practical Projects & Exercises
   - CLI tools, small web scrapers, simple web app, data parsing
   - Project structure, tests, CI basics

---
Suggested study flow: start with sections 1–5, then 6–9, follow with OOP (13), and finish with advanced topics and projects.

## Tips for beginners 💡

- Use `virtualenv`/`venv` or `pipenv` to manage dependencies
- Follow **PEP 8** for style and readability
- Practice by building small projects (CLI tools, web apps, data analysis)
