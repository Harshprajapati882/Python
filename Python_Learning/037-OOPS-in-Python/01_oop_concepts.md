# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties) and code in the form of procedures (often known as methods).

The primary principles of OOP are:

1.  **Encapsulation**: The bundling of data (attributes) and methods that operate on the data into a single unit or "class". It restricts direct access to some of an object's components, which is a means of preventing accidental interference and misuse of the data.

2.  **Abstraction**: The concept of hiding the complex reality while exposing only the essential parts. It's about simplifying complex systems by modeling classes appropriate to the problem, and providing a clear and simple interface for other parts of the program to use.

3.  **Inheritance**: A mechanism where a new class inherits attributes and methods from an existing class. The new class, called a "subclass" or "derived class", can extend and modify the behavior of the "superclass" or "base class". This promotes code reusability.

4.  **Polymorphism**: The ability of an object to take on many forms. In practice, it means that a single interface (like a method name) can be used for a general class of actions. The specific action is determined by the exact nature of the situation.
