When you create a new Django project and app, a directory structure is automatically generated. This file explains the purpose of each file and directory.

Assuming you have run:
django-admin startproject myproject
cd myproject
python manage.py startapp myapp

Your directory structure will look something like this:

myproject/
├── manage.py
├── myproject/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── asgi.py
│   ├── settings.py
│   ├── urls.py
│   └── wsgi.py
└── myapp/
    ├── __init__.py
    ├── admin.py
    ├── apps.py
    ├── migrations/
    │   └── __init__.py
    ├── models.py
    ├── tests.py
    └── views.py


--- File and Directory Explanations ---

== Outer `myproject/` Directory ==
This is just a container for your project. You can rename it to whatever you want.

  - `manage.py`:
    A command-line utility that lets you interact with this Django project in various ways. You'll use it to run the development server, create new apps, run database migrations, and more. It's your main tool for managing the project.

== Inner `myproject/` Directory ==
This is the actual Python package for your project. Its name is the Python package name you'll need to use to import anything inside it (e.g., `myproject.urls`).

  - `__init__.py`:
    An empty file that tells Python that this directory should be considered a Python package.

  - `settings.py`:
    Contains all the configuration for your Django project. This is where you'll define your database connection, installed apps, template directories, middleware, and other project-level settings.

  - `urls.py`:
    The URL declarations for your project; a "table of contents" of your Django-powered site. This file is where you define the top-level URL patterns and include URL configurations from your apps.

  - `wsgi.py` and `asgi.py`:
    Entry-points for WSGI-compatible (Web Server Gateway Interface) and ASGI-compatible (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface) web servers to serve your project. These are used for deployment.


== `myapp/` Directory ==
This is the application you created. Each app is a self-contained module that handles a specific feature.

  - `__init__.py`:
    Tells Python that this directory is a package.

  - `admin.py`:
    This is where you register your models to be included in Django's powerful, auto-generated admin interface.

  - `apps.py`:
    A configuration file for the app itself.

  - `migrations/`:
    This directory holds database migration files. Migrations are Django’s way of propagating changes you make to your models (adding a field, deleting a model, etc.) into your database schema.

  - `models.py`:
    This is where you define your application's data models. Each model is a Python class that maps to a single database table. This is the heart of your app's data structure.

  - `tests.py`:
    This file is for writing unit tests for your application.

  - `views.py`:
    This is where you define the business logic of your application. A view function, or "view," is a Python function that takes a web request and returns a web response. This response can be the HTML contents of a Web page, a redirect, a 404 error, an XML document, or an image.
